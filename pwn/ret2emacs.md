So, I've got a reputation at work for doing just about everything in Emacs. Reading my email, browsing my RSS feeds, running shell commands.. you name it. Who can blame me? It's more extensible than any other piece of software that could do those things.

To make a point, I wrote a dynamic module for parsing SIXEL during my lunch break, and I set up a Rudel server to show it off. I think this is going to blow the minds of all these VSCode losers.
